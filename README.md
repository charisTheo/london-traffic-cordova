# london-traffic-cordova

## A simple Cordova mobile app requesting and showing the traffic congestion level on the roads of London. 
* Every ~4 minutes a new image is published on the [TFL API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk) and a Lambda AWS function is checking on 3 minutes intervals for a new picture and sents the URL to an AWS EC2 Instance.
* The EC2 Instance receives the TFL image URL and downloads the image. Then sents it to IBM Watson for classification.
* The model on IBM Watson is trained so that it returns a **Congested** class if there is enough traffic shown in the picture with a specific degree of certainty. The model was negatively trained as well, where picture of light traffic have been used to train it.
* The EC2 Instance then receives the amount of traffic and is stored on the server.
* The Cordova app can request the traffic status anytime, however with an around Â±3 minutes of accuracy due to the TFL API update intervals.
